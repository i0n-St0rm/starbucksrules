Info and Rules for Starbuck's Lair:
Last update 11/16/2015
Starbuck's Lair is a privately owned and adult orientated BDSM Dungeon built primarily for Gay Men. You have to be age verified to access it, for good reason, since you will find many things like nakedness, forced or otherwise, sexual and BDSM oriented content, as well as medieval roleplay, parties, and other events.
Lair Rules: 
Rule #1 - Absolutely NO Child Avatars or Age-play Allowed! Those with questionable avatars will be warned to adjust them, if they do not do so when asked they may be banned.
Rule #2 - No Drama & No Harassment. This means You. If you are asked out of character to stop, don't complain, just Stop. 
Rule #3 - No Hate. It has no place here. Doesn't matter if you're human, fur, black, white, purple, gay, straight, male, female, or intersex. We don't care, and you shouldn't either. If you've a problem with someone because of what they are, and you can't get over it, just leave the area.
Rule #4 - Consent is required, so ask in private messages first! We get it, this is a BDSM sim, things may look a great deal more forceful in local roleplay, and some of us even enjoy that kind of thing. However it's also the modern age, and beyond the roles we play, we still need to respect each other. So if someone says No in IM, they mean NO, and you should not proceed. It doesn't matter the roleplay status of the person saying no, this rule stands.
Rule #5 - Slaves and Subs should be available to all within the limits of roleplay. You are not required to go beyond your personal limits at any time, and consent is always required. If it comes to the point where you need help getting someone to respect a No, please ask for assistance.
Rule #6 - Clean Up your Mess - Please pick up your items and Stop or Reset the devices after you have finished using them. This keeps down lag and keeps it a friendly environment. 
Rule #7 - Return the Keys - If you take the keys to someone else's items, you are expected to return them after the roleplay is complete. This also applies to leaving others locked on devices, ask them in IM if it's okay before you do it. If you do not, you will receive one warning before we take action.
Dress Code: 
* Slaves should wear only the Relay, Cuffs, Collar, and any Restraints, Toys, or other items required by their Masters. They may also wear silks unless ordered to remove them. 
* Subs are allowed to wear clothing until they are commanded to remove or replace them.
* Doms and Free Men can wear anything they like, within reason. 
The Lair is fully RLV enabled: If you are a Sub or slave we strongly recommend you use an RLV enabled browser (like Phoenix or Impudence) and that you wear a relay and cuffs. Some can be found in the Orientation area if you do not already have any, along with guides and other useful bits.
Need staff help because someone is bothering you? We have call boxes scattered around the sim. Simply activate one of these boxes when you need to get our attention for help. Note that abusing these boxes almost always end up with the abuser being banned.
