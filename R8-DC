Dress Code: 
* Slaves should wear only the Relay, Cuffs, Collar, and any Restraints, Toys, or other items required by their Masters. 
  They may also wear silks unless ordered to remove them. 

* Subs are allowed to wear clothing until they are commanded to remove or replace them.

* Doms and Free Men can wear anything they like, within reason. 

* Switches should identify and dress according to the role they are playing at any given time.  Be mindful from a roleplay
  standpoint switching from Dom to sub and vice versa in scene can be confusing.  Please be mindful of others before 
  doing so.
