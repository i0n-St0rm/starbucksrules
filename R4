Rule #4 - Consent is required, so ask in private messages first! 

We get it, this is a BDSM sim, things may look a great deal more forceful in local roleplay, and some of us even
enjoy that kind of thing.   However it's also the modern age, and beyond the roles we play, we still need to respect 
each other.  This includes interaction with those who state in their profile if their relay is open to use them.  

With the creation of "Experiences" an RLV relay may not ne needed to interact with some objects.  Therefore it is
important to get consent first.  

So if someone says No in IM, they mean NO, and you should not proceed. 
It doesn't matter the roleplay status of the person saying no, this rule stands.
