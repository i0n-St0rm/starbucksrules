Rule #4 - Consent is required, so ask in private messages first! 
We get it, this is a BDSM sim, things may look a great deal more forceful in local roleplay, and some of us even enjoy that kind of thing. 
However it's also the modern age, and beyond the roles we play, we still need to respect each other. 
So if someone says No in IM, they mean NO, and you should not proceed. 
It doesn't matter the roleplay status of the person saying no, this rule stands.
