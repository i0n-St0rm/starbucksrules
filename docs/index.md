### Our rules:

1. Absolutely NO Child Avatars or Age-play Allowed!
  -Those with questionable avatars will be warned to adjust them, if they do not do so when asked they may be banned.
1. No Drama & No Harassment.
  - This means You.
  - If you are asked out of character to stop, don't complain, just Stop.
1. No Hate. It has no place here.
  - Doesn't matter if you're human, fur, black, white, purple, gay, straight, male, female, or intersex.
  - We don't care, and you shouldn't either.
  - If you've a problem with someone because of what they are, and you can't get over it, just leave the area.
1. Consent is required, so ask in private messages first!
  - We get it, this is a BDSM sim, things may look a great deal more forceful in local roleplay, and some of us even enjoy that kind of thing.
  - However, it's also the modern age, and beyond the roles we play, we still need to respect each other.
  - So if someone says No in IM, they mean NO, and you should not proceed.
  - It doesn't matter the roleplay status of the person saying no, this rule stands.
1. Slaves and Subs should be available to all within the limits of roleplay.
  - You are not required to go beyond your personal limits at any time, and consent is always required.
  - If it comes to the point where you need help getting someone to respect a No, please ask for assistance.
1. Clean Up your Mess
  - Please pick up your items and Stop or Reset the devices after you have finished using them.
  - This keeps down lag and keeps it a friendly environment.
1. Return the Keys
  - If you take the keys to someone else's items, you are expected to return them after the roleplay is complete.
  - This also applies to leaving others locked on devices, ask them in IM if it's okay before you do it.
  - If you do not, you will receive one warning before we take action.
1. Dress Code
  - Slaves should wear only the Relay, Cuffs, Collar, and any Restraints, Toys, or other items required by their Masters. They may also wear silks unless ordered to remove them.
  - Subs are allowed to wear clothing until they are commanded to remove or replace them.
  - Doms and Free Men can wear anything they like, within reason.
