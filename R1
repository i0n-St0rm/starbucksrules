Rule #1 - Absolutely NO Child Avatars or Age-play Allowed! 

Guidelines:  Some sims will use a height meter to determine what is a child avatar and we have found this is not a good
             standard to use.  Size alone may not determine what is and is not a child avatar.  There are many short 
             avatars thatdefinately have the musculature and facial appearance of an adult.  And there are some that 
             are very tall with a slight build and a baby face.  Then there are some like the toddle-de-doo avatars
             that are unquestionably child avatars (and they will be immediately banned).  This is all determined
             by whatever manager is on duty at the time.  To protect the sim if there is ANY question -if- an avatar
             is a child avatar we will consider it to be a child avatar.
             
             Because we are an adult region that allows open sex practically anywhere, age play and child avatars
             have no place at Starbuck's lair.  This includes PRIVATE RESIDENCES that are rented.  For the purpose
             of protecting our regoin and compliance with the Linden Lab's TOS management has the right to monitor
             all areas of the sim for things that may violate Linden Lan's TOS.
 
Those with questionable avatars will be warned to adjust them, if they do not do so when asked they may be ejected 
or banned from the region.
