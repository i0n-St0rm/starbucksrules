The Lair is fully RLV enabled: If you are a Sub or slave we strongly recommend you use an RLV enabled browser (like Phoenix or Impudence) 
and that you wear a relay and cuffs. 
Some can be found in the Orientation area if you do not already have any, along with guides and other useful bits.

Need staff help because someone is bothering you? We have call boxes scattered around the sim. 
Simply activate one of these boxes when you need to get our attention for help.
Note that abusing these boxes almost always end up with the abuser being banned.
